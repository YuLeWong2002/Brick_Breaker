A multithreaded **Brick Breaker** game built in Java.  
The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball that destroys blocks, with collision physics, bonuses, penalties, and smooth UI rendering.  
The ball bounces off the UI borders and interacts with blocks using precise collision detection.

## 🎮 Features
- **Smooth Ball Physics** – accurate collision detection and response.
- **Multithreading** – separate threads for game logic, rendering, and background music.
- **Bonuses & Penalties** – power-ups and challenges to keep the game interesting.
- **Customizable Game Mechanics** – easy to tweak ball speed, block layout, etc.
- **JavaFX UI** – clean and interactive interface using `sample.fxml`.
